##  Tic Tac Toe

This is a web based tic tac toe game made with SvelteKite, NestJS, and TailwindCSS. I don't know what database I'm using yet but probably something that works with prisma. I originally planned on using Spring for the backend, hence the name "Tic Tac Spring".

If you want to run it locally:

1. Make sure you have node installed on your machine.
2. Clone the project and install the packages. (npm install or pnpm install)
3. You can enter the `nestjs` folder and start up the backend by running `npm run start:dev`.
4. Next you can enter the `frontend` folder and run `npm run dev`.
